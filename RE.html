            theme. The atmosphere from each dungeon is completely different. During the time we played it, we could feel that the game would bomb everything that the developers had imagined to the fans. This series includes all groups in all formats.

            As we move into the scene, we will let ourselves be in 2 places. The first is the gold color which gives a longer time to stay and the blue color which allows us to have different abilities. Every time we hit a blue ball, the game will randomly give us
            an ability to choose 1 out of 3 At this point, the player can choose which abilities to use to suit their fighting style or the weapons they have. However, it is a pity that The Mercenaries mode of this installment has only one playable character,
            Ethan. If there were other characters to play with, there would probably be a little more variety.
